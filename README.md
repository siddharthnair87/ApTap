## Technologies

This project was created using React.js and material ui components.

## Description

Welcome to my ApTap react app. I have actually learnt a lot about axios, material ui and react state management while building this app. I did struggle at times with styling material components as their default styles need to be overridden in some cases. It was also interested to manipulate state based on two tiles picked by the user and render that information in the drawer. I ran into a bit of trouble here as I passed a drawer component into each render of a row component. After a little assist I realised where I went wrong and refactored the code. In hindsight I should have built a component tree before attempting any code, but lesson learned.

## Future Goals

If I had a little more time on this task, I would:

- Change the typography for the entire app. I haven't used material ui because I wanted an MVP ready.
- I would have abstracted some of the logic out of the Item component. I wanted individual reusable components for this. What I have now is inefficient and verbose.
- Some of the components are not styled as shown in the screen shot. I would definately restyle wherever required.
